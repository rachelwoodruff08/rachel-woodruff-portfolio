Welcome to my professional portfolio! This repository hosts a collection of my publicly shareable work in **epidemiology**, **public health informatics**, and **data science**.

## About Me
I’m a public health scientist who’s spent over two decades turning complex data into meaningful action through analysis, interpretation and visualization. From leading national surveillance systems to modernizing informatics platforms, I’ve built a career around making data work smarter for public health. I love digging into messy datasets and collaborating across teams to solve real-world problems. With a foundation in statistical analysis—and a Data Science Specialization underway—I’m now focused on bringing those skills to roles where data science drives impact.
